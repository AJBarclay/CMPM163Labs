  For Cube 1 on the left, I used the built in three.js support for textures and chose a mossy texture.
  
  For Cube 2 in the center, I used the same built in three.js support for textures and added a corresponding normal map to the mossy    texture.
  
  For Cube 3 on the right, I used loader code and shader files to add a brick texture with custom lab3 shaders.
  
  For Cube 4 at the top, I used the built in three.js support for textures and normal maps to add a craggy rock texture and normal map.
  
  For Cube5, I used the vertex scripts for lab4 and modified the vertex shader to try and repeat the texture across the cube in a tiling pattern.  Every time I tried to change the vec2 that I would give to texture2D(), my shader code broke and my cube stopped loading. I will ask about this during next office hours, and seek more material to bolster my understanding of openGL
  
  24)A) My function would be: floor(u * 8)-1
  24)B) My function would be: floor(v * 8)-1
  24)C) The square is white

  For the left three.js material cube I used a pastel purple and transparency, for the right one I used cyan with wireframe.

  For the additional shader cube, I duplicated the aqua interpolating cube and attempted to have it interpolate between black and white   colors, but it came out as a flat red.
